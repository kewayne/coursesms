## üîç Overview  
Course SMS is a Moodle local plugin that empowers instructors and administrators to send SMS messages directly to course participants from within Moodle. This tool provides a direct and immediate communication channel, perfect for urgent announcements, reminders, or personalized messages.

The plugin features a user-friendly interface that allows for sending messages to all participants, or targeting specific roles (like all students) or groups within a course. All sent messages are logged with detailed reports on successful and failed deliveries, providing a complete audit trail.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Requires an SMS Gateway  
This plugin facilitates the sending of SMS messages from Moodle, but it does **not** send SMS messages for free. To use this plugin, you must have an active account with a third-party SMS gateway provider.

Moodle's SMS system supports various gateways, which you can configure in:  
**Site administration > Messaging > SMS gateways.**

You will need to obtain API credentials from your chosen provider and enter them into Moodle. Without a configured and enabled gateway, this plugin will not be able to send any messages.
